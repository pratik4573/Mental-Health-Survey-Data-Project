# 🧠 Mental Health in the Tech Workplace: Survey-Based Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores mental health issues in the tech industry using real survey data collected from employees across different countries. Through data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling, we uncover trends and workplace factors affecting mental well-being. The findings aim to support HR departments and companies in building more inclusive and supportive environments for mental health.
